st.write('Welcome to the Threshold Function simulator. The Threshold Function is \
a theoretical construct in population science. The paradigm this simulator is based \
on is the crowded theatre. Imagine a theatre of 330 people. Suddenly some number \
of people get up and leave. Everyone sees them leave. Depending on some threshold, \
T, which each individual has, each individual will react once their T of quickly \
exiting people is reached. You may select the form of a normal function by which \
T is distributed in the population and the original number of exiting people. The \
script will plot the population exit. Later, other distributions will be added.')
# set up population of 330
# set up streamlit selection of normal curve by input mean and sd
# set up streamlit selection of initial number to leave
# set up production of normal curve
# display normal curve
# calculate steps of exit
# display exit graph
